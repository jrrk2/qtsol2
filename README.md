A Qt Application (initially for AppleSilicon) that allows windows and matrix algebra
to be launched from Lua under the control of Sol2. The pcl branch is specialised for astronomy
and incorporates a number of elements from the Pixinsight class library(PCL) with lua wrappers to increase
flexibility. Documentation and build instructions to follow. For now it is build from source only.
There is talk of an automatic lua bindings generator which would make the task easier.
